# Orbital-Mechanics

This project's objective is to make a program that simulates gravitational mechanics and does calculations for orbit transitions.

# TODO

- [ ] Make things appear on screen
- [ ] Decide and implement a numerical method to update system
- [ ] Make two objects move
- [ ] Calculate possible stable orbits for two body system
- [ ] Add other objects
- [ ] Add numerical method selection for comparisons
- [ ] Find stable orbits in many body system (?)
- [ ] Calculate orbital transition between orbits
